        <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

        <h2>Conditions for a Refund</h2>
        <p>
          You may be eligible for a full or partial refund in the following situations:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Content Mismatch:</strong> If the content of the provided course or educational module
            on bot development significantly differs from the program stated on the
            <strong>zelux-spark.blog</strong> website at the time of purchase.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Technical Issues on Our Side:</strong> In the event of critical technical problems
            on the <strong>Zelux Spark</strong> platform that make the learning process or access
            to AI tools impossible and were not resolved by our technical support within a reasonable timeframe.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cooling-off Period:</strong> If you decide to cancel your purchase within 14 (fourteen)
            calendar days of payment, provided that you have not yet accessed a significant volume
            of the educational materials (see the "Exceptions" section).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Refund Request Procedure</h2>
        <p>
          To initiate a refund, please follow these steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Draft an official request and send it to our support email:
            <a href="mailto:support@zelux-spark.blog">support@zelux-spark.blog</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensure the subject line reads: <strong>"Refund Request"</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the body of the email, provide full details: your name, the email address used
            during registration, and the exact name of the paid course or service.
          </li>
          <li>
            Describe in detail the reason for your refund request, referring to one of the
            points in the "Conditions for a Refund" section.
          </li>
          <li>
            Upon receipt, our team will review the request within 3-5 business days and contact you.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Timeline and Method of Refund</h2>
        <p>
          Once your request is approved, the refund will be processed within 7–14 business days.
          Funds will be returned using the same payment method used for the initial transaction
          (to the same bank card or account). Please note that the actual time for the funds
          to appear may depend on your bank's or payment system's processing regulations.
        </p>

        <h2>Exceptions and Limitations</h2>
        <p>A refund cannot be issued if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The request is submitted after 14 calendar days from the date of payment.
          </li>
          <li>
            You have already studied, viewed, or downloaded more than 50% of the course/module
            materials, regardless of the time elapsed since the purchase.
          </li>
          <li>
            The inability to complete the training is due to technical issues on the user's side
            (e.g., lack of internet access, incompatible software, or hardware failure).
          </li>
          <li>
            There has been a violation of the platform's rules or the terms of the User Agreement
            on your part.
          </li>
        </ul>
