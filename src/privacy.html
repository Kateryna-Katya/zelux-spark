        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>
          The Privacy Policy applies to the personal data provided by users and clients of
          <strong>Zelux Spark</strong>, both for the provision of various information services and
          for other interactions, usually in electronic format, as well as for client
          participation in the company's training programs and promotions, in the process
          of providing technical support and service.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Zelux Spark</strong> reserves the right to make changes and additions to the
          current provisions of the Privacy Policy, and these changes and additions will
          take precedence over the current provisions. Please note that the services provided
          may contain links to third-party resources that have their own Privacy Policy
          provisions. In such cases, <strong>Zelux Spark</strong> is not responsible for the
          content and compliance with the Privacy Policy provisions of any third-party company.
          By providing your personal data, the user gives full consent to its processing
          by the methods provided for by the current provisions of the project's Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <h2>Collection, Storage, and Disposal of Personal Data</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Zelux Spark</strong> collects personal data only with the user's consent and
          solely to provide access to the platform's services that require private information:
          access to closed blog materials, bot development consultations, participation
          in promotions, and technical support. To prevent personal data leakage, a full
          range of information security measures (technical and organizational) is used.
        </p>

        <p>
          The maximum storage period for a client's personal data is 75 years from the date
          the company receives the private information. In other cases, the company stores
          the client's personal data until the activities of the
          <strong>zelux-spark.blog</strong> project cease.
        </p>

        <p>
          The destruction, depersonalization, or blocking of personal data or parts thereof
          is carried out to exclude the possibility of further processing of this information.
