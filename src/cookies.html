        <p>
          Welcome to <strong>Zelux Spark</strong>! To enhance your experience on our blog,
          ensure its proper operation, and analyze user activity in the field of AI solution development,

        <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
        <p>
          A cookie is a small piece of data (text file) that a website saves on your device
          (computer, tablet, or smartphone) when you visit it. This allows the site to "remember"
          your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size, and other settings)
          over a period of time, so you don't have to re-enter them each time you return to the
          site or browse from one page to another.
        </p>

        <h2>What types of cookies do we use?</h2>
